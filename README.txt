1)
I compare the departure times, arrival times (an travel times) of the trip sets during the simulation (with no players) vs the simulation game.
The purpose is to see if the simulations are identical when no users change the flows.

the files to do the analysis are:
r0_test_proc_trips_routes


2) 
To further investigate why the travel times of trips (even during the warmpup where no players modified the routes ) are different in the trip sets of the simulation and the game, I will run a new SG session (copy of the 631) without intervienening in the game. The results are then analysed as in 1)
